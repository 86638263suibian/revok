Architecture overview
----------------------
1 Components
Revok consists of the following components. They can be deployed in both centralized (single node) and distributed (multiple nodes) environment.

(1) Web console
Revok web console provides the user interface for submitting scan tasks.

(2) REST API
Revok REST APIs are defined to receive and handle requests from the web console.

(3) Messaging server
Messaging server stores scan requests and distributes them to Caroline nodes. When requests were received, new messages would be produced and kept in a queue until Caroline nodes consume messages from the queue.

(4) Caroline nodes
Revok Caroline nodes (working nodes) run scans with a group of testing modules and generate final scan reports.

(5) Database
Details for all scan tasks are recorded in the database. It can be used for data query or statistic.


2 Communication among components
Communication among Revok components is as below. The messaging flow is from left to right.

Use Revok to scan a target
----------------------------
Step 1: input a target URL to be scanned

Step 2: provide authentication information

Step 3: confirm and submit

Step 4: monitor scan progress from log file (var/log/carolined.log) and check report (report/report_$time.html) when scan is finished


Deploy Revok with source code
------------------------------

You can deploy web console, REST API server, messaging server, Caroline nodes (working nodes) and database server on the same host or separated hosts. In addition, you can add more than one working nodes to support parallel scans. Please refer to the installation guide for detailed steps to deploy Revok with source code.
